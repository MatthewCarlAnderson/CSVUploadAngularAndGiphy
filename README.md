# CSVUploadAngularAndGiphy - File Upload and Giphy Search - In single Visual studio 2019 project

This is a full stack (.netcore api, entityframework, Angular) implementation of a page which allows a user to upload a csv file to an entity framework table, retrieve the data uploaded as well as query for a giphy. This is built on top of the sample angular project so the default pages are still used.
